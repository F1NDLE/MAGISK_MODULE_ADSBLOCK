# MAGISK_MODULE_ADSBLOCK
A Magisk module for complete ad blocking by replacing the hosts file.

# Pros
> 1. Quick installation
> 2. Support for all types of Root access (Magisk, KernelSU, APatch)
> 3. Fully compatible with the RU_AI_UNLOCKER module (by F1NDLE)

# Cons
Frequent hosts updates. Includes OTA.

# Updates (OTA)
This is not the OTA you're used to. OTA is built into the Action. For example, if you see that the module needs an update, first read the description in the Changelog. If it says: "Hosts updated. Please update via ACTION" — just press Action, and the module will update itself along with the hosts without needing to reboot your device.
